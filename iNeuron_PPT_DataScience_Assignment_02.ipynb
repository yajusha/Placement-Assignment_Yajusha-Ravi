    "1. To calculate the mean sales for each region, you need to sum up the sales in each region and then divide by the number of data points. Here are the calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   For Region A: [10, 15, 12, 8, 14]\n",
    "   Mean = (10 + 15 + 12 + 8 + 14) / 5 = 59 / 5 = 11.8\n",
    "\n",
    "   For Region B: [18, 20, 16, 22, 25]\n",
    "   Mean = (18 + 20 + 16 + 22 + 25) / 5 = 101 / 5 = 20.2\n",
    "\n",
    "   Therefore, the mean sales for Region A is 11.8 and for Region B is 20.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. To calculate the mode of the survey responses, you need to find the value(s) that appear most frequently. Here are the calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Survey responses: [4, 5, 2, 3, 5, 4, 3, 2, 4, 5]\n",
    "   Mode = 4, 5 (as they both appear three times)\n",
    "\n",
    "   Therefore, the mode of the survey responses is 4 and 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. To calculate the median salary for each department, you need to arrange the salaries in ascending order and find the middle value. Here are the calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Department A: [5000, 6000, 5500, 7000]\n",
    "   Arranged in ascending order: [5000, 5500, 6000, 7000]\n",
    "   Median = (5500 + 6000) / 2 = 11500 / 2 = 5750\n",

    "   Department B: [4500, 5500, 5800, 6000, 5200]\n",
    "   Arranged in ascending order: [4500, 5200, 5500, 5800, 6000]\n",
    "   Median = 5500\n",
    "\n",
    "   Therefore, the median salary for Department A is 5750 and for Department B is 5500.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. To calculate the range of the stock prices, you need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum values. Here are the calculations:\n",
    "\n",
    "   Stock prices: [25.5, 24.8, 26.1, 25.3, 24.9]\n",
    "   Range = maximum value - minimum value\n",
    "         = 26.1 - 24.8\n",
    "         = 1.3\n",

    "   Group A: [85, 90, 92, 88, 91]\n",
    "   Group B: [82, 88, 90, 86, 87]\n",

    "\n",
    "   Step 2: Calculate the standard deviations for each group.\n",
    "   Standard deviation of Group A = sqrt(((85 - 89.2)^2 + (90 - 89.2)^2 + (92 - 89.2)^2 + (88 - 89.2)^2 + (91 - 89.2)^2) / 4) = 2.69\n",

    "   t = 2.6 / sqrt(5.4)\n",
    "   t ≈ 1.16\n",
    "\n",
    "   Step 4: Compare the calculated t-statistic with the critical value from the t-distribution table with the degrees of freedom (n1 + n2 - 2). If the calculated t-statistic is greater than the critical value, there is a significant difference between the means of the two groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "   For a given significance level (e.g., α = 0.05), the critical value for a two-tailed test with 8 degrees of freedom (5 + 5 - 2) is approximately ±2.31.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Since |t| = 1.16 < 2.31, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. There is not enough evidence to suggest a significant difference in the mean scores between Group A and Group B.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. To calculate the correlation coefficient between advertising expenditure and sales, you can use the Pearson correlation coefficient formula. Here are the calculations:\n",
